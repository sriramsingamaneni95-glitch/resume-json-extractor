"""
Minimal stateful agent graph — no external dependency (LangGraph-style,
but hand-rolled so it's easy to read/inspect for an assignment).

Each node is a function(state) -> state.
Each router is a function(state) -> next_node_name (or "END").
Routing decisions are made dynamically based on the shared AgentState,
not a hardcoded linear sequence.
